# README for Arduino Project: AD7193_v035_commonCode

This project began as code common with the Arduino project HX711_R4_R3_v02 which runs on both the Uno Rev3 and Uno Rev4.

As of June 5, 2024, this code assumes the Arduino R4 Minima platform and the AD7193 amplifier. AD7193-specific code based on sample code from Tacuna Systems and works with the following setup: Arduino R4 minima, Adafruit SD board, RTC_DS1307 version, PRDC_AD7193 driving and AD7193 on the Tacuna built shield with LCD screen.

As of June 4, 2024, renamed as AD7193_MOM_v01 because this is no longer beta, but is production. This code uploaded to all Kent Island bound R4 Arduinos for use in summer 2024 season.
